# Torifier
Redirect all traffic through Tor Network

# The project
With this project you can redirect all your local connection through the Tor Network.

Scripts has been tested on a Kali Linux with GNOME, other systems or configurations has not been tested.

I suggest to use this project on a dedicated system or a dedicated VM.

# First Time Usage
To redirect all connection through Tor, you have to launch the scripts in this order:
#### First:
Launch the install script, to download Tor Browser and fix some configurations on the system
#### Second:
Launch the connect script, then open Tor Browser
#### Third:
After Tor Browser connected with Tor Network, launch the system proxy script

Test for connection and DNS to ensure there are no leaks.

# Subsequent Uses

#### Second:
